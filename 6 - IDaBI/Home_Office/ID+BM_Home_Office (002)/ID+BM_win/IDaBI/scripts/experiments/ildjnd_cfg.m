% ildjnd_cfg - Interaural level difference JND
%
% This matlab skript is called by afc_main when starting
% the experiment 'example'.
% example_cfg construdts a structure 'def' containing the complete
% configuration for the experiment.
% To design an own experiment, e.g., 'myexperiment'
% make changes in this file and save it as 'myexperiment_cfg.m'.
% Ensure that none of the entries is missing.
