function framegram(F,x,varargin);
%FRAMEGRAM  Easy visualization of energy in frame space
%   Usage: framegram(F,x);
%
%   framefram(F,x) plots the energy of the coefficients computes from
%   the input signal x using the frame F for analysis. This is
%   just a shorthand for:
%
%     plotframe(F,abs(frana(F,x)).^2);
%
%   Any additional arguments given to FRAMEGRAM are passed onto
%   PLOTFRAME.
