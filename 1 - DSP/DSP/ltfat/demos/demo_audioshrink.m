%DEMO_AUDIOSHRINK  Decomposition into tonal and transient parts
%
%   This demos shows how to do audio coding and "tonal + transient"
%   decomposition using group lasso shrinkage of two WMDCT transforms
%   with different time-frequency resolutions.
%
%   The signal is transformed using two orthonormal WMDCT bases.
%   Then group lasso shrinkage is applied to the two transforms
%   in order to:
%
%      select fixed frequency lines of large WMDCT coefficients on the
%       wide window WMDCT transform
%
%      select fixed time lines of large WMDCT coefficients on the
%       narrow window WMDCT transform
% 
%   The corresponding approximated signals are computed with the
%   corresponding inverse, IWMDCT.
%
%   Figure 1: Plots and time-frequency images
%
%      The upper plots in the figure show the tonal parts of the signal, the
%      lower plots show the transients. The TF-plots on the left are the
%      corresponding wmdct coefficients found by appropriate group lasso
%      shrinkage
%
%   Corresponding reconstructed tonal and transient sounds may be
%   listened from arrays rec1 and rec2 (sampling rate: 44.1 kHz)

% Load audio signal and add noise
% -------------------------------
% Use the 'glockenspiel' signal.
sig=gspi;
fs=44100;

% Shorten signal
SigLength = 2^16;
sig = sig(1:SigLength);

% Add Gaussian white noise
nsig = sig + 0.01*randn(size(sig));

% Tonal layer
% -----------

% Create a WMDCT basis with 256 channels
F1=frametight(frame('wmdct','gauss',256));

% Compute wmdct coefficients
c1 = frana(F1,nsig);

% Group lasso and invert
[c1s,N1] = framegrouplasso(F1,c1,0.8,'soft','freq');
rec1 = frsyn(F1,c1s);

% Transient layer
% ---------------

% Create a WMDCT basis with 32 channels
F2=frametight(frame('wmdct','gauss',32));

% Compute wmdct coefficients
c2 = frana(F2,nsig);

[c2s,N2] = framegrouplasso(F2,c2,0.5,'time','soft');
rec2 = frsyn(F2,c2s);
